//    Exercise 6: Addition
//    Create a program to calculate the sum of two numbers. At the beginning of the program two variables are introduced
//    and those variables hold the numbers to be summed. Feel free to use other variables if you need to.
//    For example, if the variables hold numbers 5 and 4, the program should output:
//            5 + 4 = 9
//
//    If the variables hold numbers 73457 and 12888, the program output should be:
//            73457 + 12888 = 86345
