//16. Object
//Strings are a bit more clever and for example know how long they are:
// ...code
// We can determine the length by calling the String method length(). Strings have
// other methods as well. Integers (or whole numbers, variables of type int) have no
// methods at all. They do not "know" anything.
//Strings are objects, or "something that has methods and a value".
