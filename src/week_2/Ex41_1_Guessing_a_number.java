//Exercise 41.1: Guessing a number
//The program that comes with the exercise contains a command called drawNumber. It draws a number, which is
// in the range 0 to 100 (both 0 and 100 are possible). Create a program that draws a number. Then the user
// has the chance to guess once, what the number is. The program should to print "The number is lesser", "The
// number is greater" or "Congratulations, your guess is correct!" depending on the number the user typed.
//Guess a number: 12
//The number is greater
//
//Guess a number: 66
//The number is lesser
//
//Guess a number: 42
//Congratulations, your guess is correct!
